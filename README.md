# Hr_analytics_Using_SQL_and_PowerBI
# Data - HR Data with over 22000 rows from the year 2000 to 2020.
# Data Cleaning & Analysis - MySQL Workbench
# Data Visualization - PowerBI


# Problem:
The problem centered around analyzing a dataset of 22,000+ employee records spanning from 2000 to 2020, 
with the goal of extracting valuable insights into HR trends. 
Specific questions were posed regarding employee demographics, distribution across departments and locations, turnover rates, and changes in employee count over time.

# Solution:
The high-level solution involved using SQL in MySQL Workbench for data cleaning and analysis and Power BI for creating an insightful dashboard. 
The objective was to derive answers to key HR-related questions by exploring the dataset and visualizing the findings in a comprehensive Power BI dashboard.

# How I Approached It:
The approach began with thorough data cleaning and analysis in MySQL Workbench, addressing issues such as negative ages and future term dates. 
A series of SQL queries were executed to extract relevant information. The data was then imported into Power BI for visualization. 
Each question was tackled systematically, with appropriate SQL queries extracting the required data, and Power BI was used to create visualizations for easy interpretation.


# What I Found:

1. The gender breakdown showed a higher number of male employees.
2. White was the dominant race, while Native Hawaiian and American Indian were the least represented.
3. The age distribution revealed the youngest and oldest employees, and age groups were created to show the distribution.
4. A significant number of employees worked at headquarters versus remote locations.
5. The average length of employment for terminated employees was approximately 7 years.
6. Gender distribution across departments was generally balanced, with a slight male predominance.
7. The Marketing department had the highest turnover rate, while Research and Development, Support, and Legal had the lowest.
8. Many employees came from the state of Ohio.
9. The company's employee count increased over the years.
10. The average tenure for each department was around 8 years, with Legal and Auditing having the highest and Services, Sales, and Marketing having the lowest.


# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project effectively addressed HR-related questions by employing SQL for data cleaning and analysis and Power BI for visualization. Valuable insights were gained into employee demographics, distribution, turnover rates, and changes over time. 
The findings can serve as a basis for informed HR decision-making, while the limitations, such as excluding records with negative ages and future term dates, were acknowledged and documented for transparency. Overall, the project demonstrated the power of combining SQL and Power BI for comprehensive HR analytics.
